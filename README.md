In this project, I learned more about the Caesar Cypher which was used to send classified messages through changing the order of the words by a certain factor, usually denoted by a variable. For example, we can change the letter a to c if we move all the letters by 2, which can be set as k = 2. As long as the person knows the factor by which you changed the new message, they can figure out the new message.

Computers also have a numerical system for the letters called the ACII system and we can use the Char function to encrypt and decrypt messages. We can also convert letters to numbers as part of the code.
